## To Ascend Pixel

I've attached sample scripts of my code logic that has been implemented since 2024. The reason I'm not showing up-to-date full scope projects is because it contains information and alpha that is currently in production, or it involves a third party. With that said, I'm happy to answer any questions you may have during the interview process to see if we're a match. Below, I've attached more references that showcase more recent work. Talk soon ! 

## Live Health Monitoring Systems 

Finding alpha on it's own is not enough, as market regimes tend to change, underlying data distributions shift. That is why the first step to creating truly profitable trading systems is through some sort of "active monitoring", and we do that by first having reliable data infrastructures /  systems in place. This can be generalized across different business functions, such as factor monitoring, strategy/portfolio monitoring, etc...

## Browser Automation (OpenClaw Lookalike)

I've built this tool to solve menial everyday tasks that require expensive manpower, even before the current openclaw project went viral. The backbone of the system isn't AI. It does not have an LLM orchestration layer. It operates by managing it's own instance of chromium / chrome drivers. This allows the "agent" to automate browser actions. Think of it as a "programatic" version of OpenClaw where it can be systematically integrated as a datasource service, or "agent".
